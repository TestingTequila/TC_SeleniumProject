      @BeforeMethod : This will be executed before every @Test annotation

      @DataProvider: Fetching multiple data: Parametrization
      @Parameter   : To fetch data from xml file

    //Attributes : We use it along with Annotations
      priority: Defined execution order
      enabled : Defines what is executed or not executed
      timeOut : defines limit for time
      groups  : for grouping test cases
      dependsOnMethods: Will execute only if depending method passes else will be skipped
      dependsOnGroups: Will execute only if depending all groups passes else will be skipped
      alwaysRun: this will always be executed
      invocationCount: will execute the test case for given number of count

    //Assertions : To validate
    AssertTrue: will validate true
    AssertFalse: will validate false
    AssertEquals: will compare expected with actual
    AssertNotEquals: will compare expected with actual
    Hard Vs Soft Assertion
